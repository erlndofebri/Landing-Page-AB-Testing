# Landing Page AB Testing
the goal of this project is to test new landing page whether it can brings significantly higher conversion rate or not.


## Experiment 

#### 1) What is the name of the experiment?
AB Test New Design for Landing Page Design

#### 2) Define Hypothesis
- H0 : existing design and new design have same conversion rate
- H1 : existing design and new design do not have same conversion rate

#### 3) Who is the participant?
The user that visit landing page

#### 4) What variables will be tested?
New Page & Old Page

#### 5.) Define Metric
Metric : Conversion Rate

#### 6.) Define Sample Size
We need at least 4402 user samples obvservation for each group. This is just for the sake of the exercise and we keep use all the users given (because the available datasets are intended for a/b testing purposes, so when we use all of these datasets, it will not interfere with other users who are not tested)

#### 7.) Define Duration
- First Session Datetime : 2017-01-02 13:42:05.378582
- Last Session Datetime : 2017-01-24 13:41:54.460509
- This experimental design run for 22 Days

#### 8.) Test Experiment
There's no difference between new page and old page in terms of num of converted customer. So, new page design failed to gain more converted customer. We can use existing page or new page in for implementation (they didn't bring much difference on number of converted customer)
